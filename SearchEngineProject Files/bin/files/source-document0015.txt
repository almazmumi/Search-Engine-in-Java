uds: in the Red Maple, only the middle one is a leaf-bud, and it does not grow until after those on each side of it have expanded the blossoms they contain. [Illustration: Fig. 78. Butternut branch, with accessory buds, the uppermost above the axil.] [Illustration: Fig. 79. Red-Maple branch, with accessory buds placed side by side. The annular lines toward the base in this and in Fig. 72 are scars of the bud-scales, and indicate the place of the winter-bud of the preceding year.] 60. =Sorts of Buds.= It may be useful to enumerate the kinds of buds which have been described or mentioned. They are _Terminal_, when they occupy the summit of (or terminate) a stem, _Lateral_, when they are borne on the side of a stem; of which the regular kind is the _Axillary_, situated in the axil of a leaf. These are _Accessory_ or _Supernumerary_, when they are in addition to the normal solitary bud; and these are _Collateral_, when side by side; _Superposed_, when one above another; _Extra-axillary_, when they appear above the axil, as some do when superposed, and as occasionally is the case when single. _Naked buds_; those which have no protecting scales. _Scaly buds_; those which have protecting scales, which are altered leaves or bases of leaves. _Leaf-buds_, contain or give rise to leaves, and develop into a leafy shoot. _Flower-buds_, contain or consist of blossoms, and no leaves. _Mixed buds_, contain both leaves and blossoms. 61. =Definite annual Growth= from winter buds is marked in most of the shoots from strong buds, such as those of the Horse-chestnut and Hickory (Fig. 72, 73). Such a bud generally contains, already formed in miniature, all or a great part of the leaves and joints of stem it is to produce, makes its whole growth in length in the course of a few weeks, or sometimes even in a few days, and then forms and ripens its buds for the next year's similar growth. 62. =Indefinite annual Growth=, on the other hand, is well marked in such trees or shrubs as the Honey-Locust, Sumac, and in sterile shoots of the Rose, Blackberry, and Raspberry. That is, these shoots are apt to grow all summer long, until stopped by the frosts of autumn or some other cause. Consequently they form and ripen no terminal bud protected by scales, and the upper axillary buds are produced so late in the season that they have no time to mature, nor has their wood time to solidify and ripen. Such stems therefore commonly die back from the top in winter, or at least all their upper buds are small and feeble; so the growth of the succeeding year takes place mainly from the lower axillary buds, which are more mature. 63. =Deliquescent and Excurrent Growth.= In the former case, and wherever axillary buds take the lead, there is, of course, no single main stem, continued year after year in a direct line, but the trunk is soon lost in the branches. Trees so formed commonly have rounded or spreading tops. Of such trees with _deliquescent_ stems,--that is, with the trunk dissolved, as it were, into the successively divided branches,--the common American Elm (Fig. 80) is a good illustration. [Illustration: Fig. 80. An American Elm, with Spruce-trees, and on the left Arbor Vit√¶.] 64. On the other hand, the main stem of Firs and Spruces, unless destroyed by some injury, is carried on in a direct line throughout the whole growth of the tree, by the development year after year of a terminal bud: this forms a single, uninterrupted shaft,--an _excurrent_ trunk, which cannot be confounded with the branches that proceed from it. Of such _spiry_ or _spire-shaped_ trees, the Firs or Spruces are characteristic and familiar examples. There are all gradations between the two modes. Section V. ROOTS. 65. It is a property of stems to produce roots. Stems do not spring from roots in ordinary cases, as is generally thought, but roots from stems. When perennial herbs arise from the ground, as they do at spring-time, they rise from subterranean stems. 66. =The Primary Root= is a downward growth from the root-end of the caulicle, that is, of the initial stem of the embryo (Fig. 5-7, 81). If it goes on to grow it makes a _main_ or _tap-root_, as in Fig. 37, etc. Some plants keep this main root throughout their whole life, and send off only small side branches; as in the Carrot and Radish: and in various trees, like the Oak, it takes the lead of the side-branches for several years, unless accidentally injured, as a strong tap-root. But commonly the main root divides off very soon, and is lost in the branches. _Multiple primary roots_ now and then occur, as in the seedling of Pumpkin (Fig. 27), where a cluster is formed even at the first, from the root-end of the caulicle. [Illustration: Fig. 81. Seedling Maple, of the natural size; the root well supplied with root hairs, here large enough to be seen by the naked eye. 82. Lower end of this root, magnified, the root seen just as root-hairs are beginning to form a little behind the tip.] 67. =Secondary Roots= are those which arise from other parts of the stem. Any part of the stem may produce them, but they most readily come from the nodes. As a general rule they naturally spring, or may be made to spring, from almost any young stem, when placed in favorable circumstances,--that is, when placed in the soil, or otherwise supplied with moisture and screened from the light. For the special tendency of the root is to avoid the light, seek moisture, and therefore to bury itself in the soil. _Propagation by division_, which is so common and so very important in cultivation, depends upon the proclivity of stems to strike root. Stems or branches which remain under ground give out roots as freely as roots themselves give off branches. Stems which creep on the ground most commonly root at the joints; so will most branches when bent to the ground, as in propagation by _layering_; and propagation by _cuttings_ equally depends upon the tendency of the cut end of a shoot to produce roots. Thus, a piece of a plant which has stem and leaves, either developed or in the bud, may be made to produce roots, and so become an independent plant. 68. =Contrast between Stem and Root.= Stems are ascending axes; roots are descending axes. Stems grow by the successive development of internodes (13), one after another, each leaf-bearing at its summit (or node); so that it is of the essential nature of a stem to bear leaves. Roots bear no leaves, are not distinguishable into nodes and internodes, but grow on continuously from the lower end. They commonly branch freely, but not from any fixed points nor in definite order. 69. Although roots generally do not give rise to stems, and therefore do not propagate the plant, exceptions are not uncommon. For as stems may produce adventitious buds, so also may roots. The roots of the Sweet Potato among herbs, and of the Osage Orange among trees freely produce adventitious buds, developing into leafy shoots; and so these plants are propagated by _root-cuttings_. But most growths of subterranean origin which pass for roots are forms of stems, the common Potato for example. 70. Roots of ordinary kinds and uses may be roughly classed into _fibrous_ and _fleshy_. 71. =Fibrous Roots=, such as those of Indian Corn (Fig. 70), of most annuals, and of many perennials, serve only for absorption: these are slender or thread-like. Fine roots of this kind, and the fine branches which most roots send out are called ROOTLETS. 72. The whole surface of a root absorbs moisture from the soil while fresh and new; and the newer roots and rootlets are, the more freely do they imbibe. Accordingly, as long as the plant grows above ground, and expands fresh foliage, from which moisture largely escapes into the air, so long it continues to extend and multiply its roots in the soil beneath, renewing and increasing the fresh surface for absorbing moisture, in proportion to the demand from above. And when growth ceases above ground, and the leaves die and fall, or no longer act, then the roots generally stop growing, and their soft and tender tips harden. From this period, therefore, until growth begins anew the next spring, is the best time for transplanting; especially for trees and shrubs. 73. The absorbing surface of young roots is much increased by the formation, near their tips, of ROOT-HAIRS (Fig. 81, 82), which are delicate tubular outgrowths from the surface, through the delicate walls of which moisture is promptly imbibed. [Illustration: Fig. 83-85. Forms of tap-root.] 74. =Fleshy Roots= are those in which the root becomes a storehouse of nourishment. Typical roots of this kind are those of such biennials as the turnip and carrot; in which the food created in the first season's vegetation is accumulated, to be expended the next season in a vigorous growth and a rapid development of flowers, fruit, and seed. By the time the seed is matured the exhausted root dies, and with it the whole plant. 75. Fleshy roots may be single or multiple. The single root
