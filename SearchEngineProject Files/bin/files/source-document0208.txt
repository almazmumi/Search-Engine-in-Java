In Western countries, people are considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, exceeds 30 kg/m2, with the range 25-30 kg/m2 defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use stricter criteria. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food energy intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, although a few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or psychiatric illness. Evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is limited. Dieting and exercising are the main treatments for obesity. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber.  and in _Podosperm_, a seed stalk or funiculus. _Pogon_, Greek for beard, comes into various compounds. _Pointless_, destitute of any pointed tip, such as a _mucro_, _awn_, _acumination_, &c. _Pollen_, the fertilizing powder contained in the anther, 14, 80, 103. _Pollen-growth_, 117. _Polleniferous_, pollen-bearing. _Pollen-mass_, _Pollinium_, the united mass of pollen, 104, as in Milkweed and Orchis. _Pollicaris_, Latin for an inch long. _Pollination_, the application of pollen to the stigma, 114. _Poly-_, in compound words of Greek origin, same as _multi-_ in those of Latin origin viz. many, as _Polyadelphous_, stamens united by their filaments into several bundles, 100. _Polyandrous_, with numerous stamens (inserted on the receptacle), 100. _Polycarpic_, term used by DeCandolle in the sense of perennial. _Polycotyledonous_, having many (more than two) cotyledons, as Pines, 23. _Polygamous_, having some perfect and some unisexual flowers, 85. _Polygonal_, many-angled. _Polygynous_, with many pistils or styles, 105. _Polymerous_, formed of many parts of each set. _Polymorphous_, of several or varying forms. _Polypetalous_, when the petals are distinct or separate (whether few or many), 89. _Polyphyllous_, many-leaved; formed of several distinct pieces. _Polysepalous_, same as the last when applied to the calyx, 89. _Polyspermous_, many-seeded. _Pome_, the apple, pear, and similar fleshy fruits, 119. _Pomiferous_, pome-bearing. _Porrect_, outstretched. _Posterior_ side or portion of a flower (when axillary) is that toward the axis, 96. _Pouch_, the silicle or short pod, as of Shepherd's Purse, 123. _Præcocious_ (Latin, _præcox_), unusually early in development. _Præfloration_, same as _æstivation_, 97. _Præfoliation_, same as _vernation_, 71. _Præmorse_, ending abruptly, as if bitten off. _Pratensis_, Latin for growing in meadows. _Prickles_, sharp elevations of the bark, coming off with it, as of the Rose. _Prickly_, bearing prickles, or sharp projections like them. _Primine_, the outer coat of the covering of the ovule, 110. _Primordial_, earliest formed; primordial leaves are the first after the cotyledons. _Prismatic_, prism-shaped; having three or more angles bounding flat sides. _Procerous_, tall, or tall and slim.
