The Matiyasevich/MRDP Theorem relates two notions — one from computability theory, the other from number theory — and has some surprising consequences. Perhaps the most surprising is the existence of a universal Diophantine equation: There exists a polynomial p(a,n,x_1,\ldots,x_k) such that, given any Diophantine set S there is a number n_0 such that S = \{\,a \mid \exists x_1, \ldots, x_k[p(a,n_0,x_1,\ldots,x_k)=0]\,\}. This is true simply because Diophantine sets, being equal to recursively enumerable sets, are also equal to Turing machines. It is a well known property of Turing machines that there exist universal Turing machines, capable of executing any algorithm. Hilary Putnam has pointed out that for any Diophantine set S of positive integers, there is a polynomial q(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)\, such that S consists of exactly the positive numbers among the values assumed by q as the variables x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n\, range over all natural numbers. This can be seen as follows: If p(a,y_1,\ldots,y_n)=0\, provides a Diophantine definition of S, then it suffices to set q(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)= x_0[1- p(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)^2].\, So, for example, there is a polynomial for which the positive part of its range is exactly the prime numbers. (On the other hand no polynomial can only take on prime values.) Other applicaCricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each on a field at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard long pitch. Each team takes its turn to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. Each turn is known as aninnings.tions concern what logicians refer to as \Pi^{0}_1 propositions, sometimes also called propositions of Goldbach type.[6] These are like the Goldbach Conjecture, in stating that all natural numbers possess a certain property that is algorithmically checkable for each particular number.[7] The Matiyasevich/MRDP Theorem implies that each such proposition is equivalent to a statement that asserts that some particular Diophantine equation has no solutions in natural numbers.[8] A number of important and celebrated problems are of this form: in particular, Fermat's Last Theorem, the Riemann Hypothesis, and the Four Color Theorem. In addition the assertion that particular formal systems such as Peano Arithmetic or ZFC are consistent can be expressed as \Pi^{0}_1 sentences. The idea is to follow Kurt Gödel in coding proofs by natural numbers in such a way that the property of being the number representing a proof is algorithmically checkable. \Pi^{0}_1 sentences have the special property that if they are false, that fact will be provable in any of the usual formal systems. This is because the falsity amounts to the existence of a counter-example which can be verified by simple arithmetic. So if a \Pi^{0}_1 sentence is such that neither it nor its negation is provable in one of these systems, that sentence must be true. A particularly striking form of Gödel's incompleteness theorem is also a consequence of the Matiyasevich/MRDP Theorem: Let p(a,x_1,\ldots,x_k)=0\, provide a Diophantine definition of a non-computable set. Let A be an algorithm that outputs a sequence of natural numbers n such that the corresponding equation p(n,x_1,\ldots,x_k)=0\, has no solutions in natural numbers. Then there is a number n_0 which is not output by A while in fact the equation p(n_0,x_1,\ldots,x_k)=0\, has no solutions in natural numbers. To see that the theorem is true, it suffices to notice that if there were no such number n_0, one could algorithmically test membership of a number n in this non-computable set by simultaneously running the algorithm A to see whether n is output while also checking all possible k-tuples of natural numbers seeking a solution of the equation p(n,x_1,\ldots,x_k)=0. We may associate an algorithm A with any of the usual formal systems such as Peano Arithmetic or ZFC by letting it systematically generate consequences of the axioms and then output a number n whenever a sentence of the form \neg \exists x_1,\ldots , x_k [p(n,x_1,\ldots,x_k)=0]\, is generated. Then the theorem tells us that either a false statement of this form is proved or a true one remains unproved in the system in question.Julia Robinson and Yuri Matiyasevich showed that every Diophantine set has dimension no greater than 13. Later, Matiyasevich sharpened their methods to show that 9 unknowns suffice. Although it may well be that this result is not the best possible, there has been no further progress.[9] So, in particular, there is no algorithm for testing Diophantine equations with 9 or fewer unknowns for solvability in natural numbers. For the case of rational integer solutions (as Hilbert had originally posed it), the 4 squares trick shows that there is no algorithm for equations with no more than 36 unknowns. But Zhi Wei Sun showed that the problem for integers is unsolvable even for equations with no more than 11 unknowns. Martin Davis studied algorithmic questions involving the number of solutions of a Diophantine equation. Hilbert's tenth problem asks whether or not that number is 0. Let A=\{0,1,2,3,\ldots,\aleph_0\} and let C be a proper non-empty subset of A. Davis proved that there is no algorithm to test a given Diophantine equation to determine whether the number of its solutions is a member of the set C. Thus there is no algorithm to determine whether the number of solutions of a Diophantine equation is finite, odd, a perfect square, a prime, etc.
