e left out of view. The want of symmetry is in the stamens. These are in two circles, an outer and an inner. The outer circle consists of two stamens only; the inner has its proper number of four. The flower of Violet, which is on the plan of five, is symmetrical in calyx, corolla, and stamens, inasmuch as each of these circles consists of five members; but it is conspicuously irregular in the corolla, one of the petals being very different from the rest. [Illustration: Fig. 239. Flower of a Larkspur. 240. Its calyx and corolla displayed; the five larger parts are the sepals; the four smaller, of two shapes, are the petals; the place of the fifth petal is vacant. 241. Diagram of the same; the place for the missing petal marked by a dotted line.] [Illustration: Fig. 242. Flower of a Monkshood. 243. Its parts displayed; five sepals, the upper forming the hood; the two lateral alike, broad and flat; the two lower small. The two pieces under the hood represent the corolla, reduced to two odd-shaped petals; in centre the numerous stamens and three pistils. 244. Diagram of the calyx and corolla; the three dotted lines in the place of missing petals.] 254. The flowers of Larkspur, and of Monkshood or Aconite, which are nearly related, are both strikingly irregular in calyx and corolla, and considerably unsymmetrical. In Larkspur (Fig. 239-241) the irregular calyx consists of five sepals, one of which, larger than the rest, is prolonged behind into a large sac or spur; but the corolla is of only four petals (of two shapes),--the fifth, needed to complete the symmetry, being left out. And the Monkshood (Fig. 242-244) has five very dissimilar sepals, and a corolla of only two very small and curiously-shaped petals,--the three needed to make up the symmetry being left out. The stamens in both are out of symmetry with the ground-plan, being numerous. So are the pistils, which are usually diminished to three, sometimes to two or to one. 255. =Flowers with Multiplication of Parts= are very common. The stamens are indefinitely numerous in Larkspur and in Monkshood (Fig. 242, 243), while the pistils are fewer than the ground-plan suggests. Most Cactus-flowers have all the organs much increased in number (Fig. 229), and so of the Water-Lily. In Anemone (Fig. 233) the stamens and pistils are multiplied while the petals are left out. In Buttercups or Crowfoot, while the sepals and petals conform to the ground-plan of five, both stamens and pistils are indefinitely multiplied (Fig. 245). [Illustration: Fig. 245. Flower of Ranunculus bulbosus, or Buttercup, in section.] 256. =Flowers modified by Union of Parts=, so that these parts more or less lose the appearance of separate leaves or other organs growing out of the end of the stem or receptacle, are extremely common. There are two kinds of such union, namely:-- _Coalescence_ of parts of the same circle by their contiguous margins; and _Adnation_, or the union of adjacent circles or unlike parts. 257. =Coalescence= is not rare in leaves, as in the upper pairs of Honeysuckles, Fig. 163. It may all the more be expected in the crowded circles or whorls of flower-leaves. Datura or Stramonium (Fig. 246) shows this coalescence both in calyx and corolla, the five sepals and the five petals being thus united to near their tips, each into a tube or long and narrow cup. These unions make needful the following terms:-- _Gamopetalous_, said of a corolla the petals of which are thus coalescent into one body, whether only at base or higher. The union may extend to the very summit, as in Morning Glory and the like (Fig. 247), so that the number of petals in it may not be apparent. The old name for this was _Monopetalous_, but that means "one-petalled;" while gamopetalous means "petals united," and therefore is the proper term. [Illustration: Fig. 246. Flower of Datura Stramonium; gamosepalous and gamopetalous.] [Illustration: Fig. 247. Funnelform corolla of a common Morning Glory, detached from its polysepalous calyx.] _Polypetalous_ is the counterpart term, to denote a corolla of _distinct_, that is, separate petals. As it means "many petalled," it is not the best possible name, but it is the old one and in almost universal use. _Gamosepalous_ applies to the calyx when the sepals are in this way united. _Polysepalous_, to the calyx when of separate sepals or calyx-leaves. 258. Degree of union or of separation in descriptive botany is expressed in the same way as is the lobing of leaves (139). See Fig. 249-253, and the explanations. 259. A corolla when gamopetalous commonly shows a distinction (well marked in Fig. 249-251) between a contracted tubular portion below, the TUBE, and the spreading part above, the BORDER or LIMB. The junction between tube and limb, or a more or less enlarged upper portion of the tube between the two, is the THROAT. The same is true of the calyx. 260. Some names are given to particular forms of the gamopetalous corolla, applicable also to a gamosepalous calyx, such as _Wheel-shaped_, or _Rotate_; when spreading out at once, without a tube or with a very short one, something in the shape of a wheel or of its diverging spokes, Fig. 252, 253. _Salver-shaped_, or _Salver-form_; when a flat-spreading border is raised on a narrow tube, from which it diverges at right angles, like the salver represented in old pictures, with a slender handle beneath, Fig. 249-251, 255.

Often the text relates to the object, such as an address on an envelope, product info on packaging, or text on a traffic or street sign. A slogan may be painted on a wall.

Flower of Standing Cypress (Gilia coronopifolia); gamopetalous: the tube answering to the long claws in 248, except that they are coalescent: the limb or border (the spreading part above) is _five-parted_, that is, the petals not there united except at very base.] [Illustration: Fig. 250.

Wheel-shaped or rotate and five-parted corolla of Bittersweet, Solanum Dulcamara. 253. Wheel-shaped and five-lobed corolla of Potato.] _Bell-shaped_, or _Campanulate_; where a short and broad tube widens upward, in the shape of a bell, as in Fig. 254. [Illustration: Fig. 254. Flower of a Campanula or Harebell, with a campanulate or bell-shaped corolla; 255, of a Phlox, with salver-shaped corolla; 256, of Dead Nettle (Lamium), with labiate _ringent_ (or gaping) corolla; 257, of Snapdragon, with labiate _personate_ corolla; 258, of Toad-Flax, with a similar corolla spurred at the base.] _Funnel-shaped_, or _Funnelform_; gradually spreading at the summit of a tube which is narrow below, in the shape of a funnel or tunnel, as in the corolla of the common Morning Glory (Fig. 247) and of the Stramonium (Fig. 246). _Tubular_; when prolonged into a tube, with little or no spreading at the border, as in the corolla of the Trumpet Honeysuckle, the calyx of Stramonium (Fig. 246), etc. 261. Although sepals and petals are usually all blade or lamina (123), like a sessile leaf, yet they may have a contracted and stalk-like base, answering to petiole. This is called its CLAW, in Latin _Unguis_. _Unguiculate_ petals are universal and strongly marked in the Pink tribe, as in Soapwort (Fig. 248). [Illustration: Fig. 259. Unguiculate (clawed) petal of a Silene; with a two-parted crown.] [Illustration: Fig. 260. A small Passion-flower, with crown of slender threads.] 262. Such petals, and various others, may have an outgrowth of the inner face into an appendage or fringe, as in Soapwort, and in Silene (Fig. 259), where it is at the junction of claw and blade. This is called a CROWN, or _Corona_. In Passion-flowers (Fig. 260) the crown consists of numerous threads on the base of each petal. [Illustration: Fig. 261. Front view of a papilionaceous corolla. 262. The parts of the same, displayed: _s_, Standard, or Vexillum; _w_, Wings, or Alæ; _k_, Keel, or Carina.] 263. =Irregular Flowers= may be polypetalous, or nearly so, as in the papilionaceous corolla; but most of them are irregular through coalescence, which often much disguises the numerical symmetry also. As affecting the corolla the following forms have received particular names: 264. =Papilionaceous Corolla=, Fig. 261, 262. This is polypetalous, except that two of the petals cohere, usually but slightly. It belongs only to the Leguminous or Pulse family. The name means butterfly-like; but the likeness is hardly obvious. The names of the five petals of the _papilionaceous_ corolla are curiously incongruous. They are, The STANDARD or _Banner_ (_Vexillum_), the large upper petal which is external in the bud and wrapped around the others. The WINGS (_Alæ_), the pair of side petals, of quite different shape from the standard. The KEEL (_Carina_), the two lower and usually smallest petals; these are lightly coalescent into a body which bears some likeness, not to the keel, but to the p
