The Program Global Area[22][23] or PGA memory-area of an Oracle instance contains data and control-information for Oracle's server-processes. The size and content of the PGA depends on the Oracle-server options installed. This area consists of the following components: stack-space: the memory that holds the session's variables, arrays, and so on session-information: unless using the multithreaded server, the instance stores its session-information in the PGA. In a multithreaded server, the session-information goes in the SGA.) private SQL-area: an area that holds information such as bind-variables and runtime-buffers sorting area: an area in the PGA that holds information on sorts, hash-joins, etc. DBAs can monitor PGA usage via the system view. Dynamic performance views[edit] The dynamic performance views (also known as "fixed views") within an Oracle database present information from virtual tables (X$ tables)[24] built on the basis of database memory.[25] Database users can access the V$ views (named after the prefix of their synonyms) to obtain information on database structures and performance. Process architectures[edit] Oracle processes[edit] The Oracle RDBMS typically relies on a group of processes running simultaneously in the background and interacting to monitor and expedite database operations. Typical operating environments might include - temporarily or permanently - some of the following individual processes (shown along with their abbreviated nomenclature):[26] advanced queueing processes (Qnnn)[27] archiver processes (ARCn) checkpoint process (CKPT) *REQUIRED* coordinator-of-job-queues process (CJQn): dynamically spawns slave processes for job-queues database writer processes (DBWn) *REQUIRED* dispatcher processes (Dnnn): multiplex server-processes on behalf of users main Data Guard Broker monitor process (DMON)[28] job-queue slave processes (Jnnn)[29] log-writer process (LGWR) *REQUIRED* log-write network-server (LNSn): transmits redo logs in Data Guard environments logical standby coordinator process (LSP0): controls Data Guard log-application media-recovery process (MRP): detached recovery-server process memory-manager process (MMAN): used for internal database tasks such as Automatic Shared Memory Management (ASMM) memory-monitor process (MMON): process for automatic problem-detection, self-tuning and statistics-gathering[30] memory-monitor light process (MMNL): gathers and stores Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) data mmon slaves (Mnnnn—M0000, M0001, etc.): background slaves of the MMON process[31] process-monitor process (PMON) *REQUIRED* process-spawner process (PSP0): spawns Oracle background processes after initial instance startup[32] queue-monitor coordinator process (QMNC): dynamically spawns queue monitor slaves[33] queue-monitor processes (QMNn) recoverer process (RECO) remote file-server process (RFS) - in Oracle Data Guard, a standby recipient of primary redo-logs[34] shared server processes (Snnn): serve client-requests system monitor process (SMON) *REQUIRED* Oracle Database terminology distinguishes different computer-science terms in describing how end-users interact with the database: user processes involve the invocation of application software[35] a connection refers to the pathway linking a user process to an Oracle instance[36] sessions consist of specific connections to an Oracle instance.[37] Each session within an instance has a session identifier or "SID"[38] (distinct from the system-identifier SID). Concurrency and locking[edit] Oracle databases control simultaneous access to data resources with locks (alternatively documented as "enqueues").[39] The databases also utilize "latches" - low-level serialization mechanisms to protect shared data structures in the System Global Area.[40] Configuration[edit] Database administrators control many of the tunable variations in an Oracle instance by means of values in a parameter file.[41] This file in its ASCII default form ("pfile") normally has a name of the format init<SID-name>.ora. The default binary equivalent server parameter file ("spfile") (dynamically reconfigurable to some extent)[42] defaults to the format spfile<SID-name>.ora. Within an SQL-based environment, the views V$PARAMETER[43] and V$SPPARAMETER[44] give access to reading parameter values. Administration[edit] The "Scheduler" (DBMS_SCHEDULER package, available from Oracle 10g onwards) and the Job subsystem (DBMS_JOB package) permit the automation of predictable processing.[45] Oracle Resource Manager aims to allocate CPU resources between users and groups of users when such resources become scarce.[46] Oracle Corporation stated in product announcements that manageability for DBAs had improved from Oracle9i to 10g. Lungu and Vătuiu (2008) assessed the relative manageability by performing common DBA tasks and measuring timings. [47] They performed their tests on a single Pentium CPU (1.7 GHz) with 512 MB RAM,running Windows Server 2000. From Oracle9i to 10g, installation improved 36%, day-to-day administration 63%, backup and recovery 63%, and performance diagnostics and tuning 74%, for a weighted total improvement of 56%. The researchers concluded that "Oracle10g represents a giant step forward from Oracle9i in making the database easier to use and manage". Network access[edit] Oracle Net Services allow client or remote applications to access Oracle databases via network sessions using various protocols. Internationalization[edit] Oracle Database software comes in 63 language-versions (including regional variations such as British English and American English). Variations between versions cover the names of days and months, abbreviations, time-symbols (such as A.M. and A.D.), and sorting.[48] Oracle Corporation has translated Oracle Database error-messages into Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai and Turkish.[49] Oracle Corporation provides database developers with tools and mechanisms for producing internationalized database applications: referred to internally as "Globalization".
