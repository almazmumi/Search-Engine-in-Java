 Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for business process modeling that provides a graphical notation for specifying business processes in a Business Process Diagram (BPD),[2] based on a flowcharting technique very similar to activity diagrams from Unified Modeling Language (UML).[3] The objective of BPMN is to supportbusiness process management, for both technical users and business users, by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users, yet able to represent complex process semantics. The BPMN specification also provides a mapping between the graphics of the notation and the underlying constructs of execution languages, particularly Business Process Execution Language (BPEL).[4] The primary goal of BPMN is to provide a standard notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders. These include the business analysts who create and refine the processes, the technical developers responsible for implementing them, and the business managers who monitor and manage them. Consequently, BPMN serves as a common language, bridging the communication gap that frequently occurs between business process design and implementation. Currently there are several competing standards for business process modeling languages used by modeling tools and processes.[5] Widespread adoption of the BPMN will help unify the expression of basic business process concepts (e.g., public and private processes, choreographies), as well as advanced process concepts (e.g., exception handling, transaction compensation). BPMN topics[edit] Scope[edit] BPMN is constrained to support only the concepts of modeling applicable to business processes. Other types of modeling done by organizations for non-process purposes are out of scope for BPMN. Examples of modeling excluded from BPMN are: Organizational structures Functional breakdowns Data models [6] In addition, while BPMN shows the flow of data (messages), and the association of data artifacts to activities, it is not a data flow diagram. Elements[edit] BPMN models consist of simple diagrams constructed from a limited set of graphical elements. For both business users and developers, they simplify understanding business activities' flow and process. BPMN's four basic element categories are: Flow objects Events, activities, gateways Connecting objects Sequence flow, message flow, association Swim lanes Pool, lane Artifacts Data object, group, annotation These four categories enable creation of simple business process diagrams (BPDs). BPDs also permit making new types of flow object or artifact, to make the diagram more understandable. Flow objects are the main describing elements within BPMN, and consist of three core elements: events, activities, and gateways. Event An Event is represented with a circle and denotes something that happens (compared with an activity, which is something that is done). Icons within the circle denote the type of event (e.g., an envelope representing a message, or a clock representing time). Events are also classified as Catching (for example, if catching an incoming message starts a process) or Throwing (such as throwing a completion message when a process ends). Start event Acts as a process trigger; indicated by a single narrow border, and can only be Catch, so is shown with an open (outline) icon. Intermediate event Represents something that happens between the start and end events; is indicated by a double border, and can Throw or Catch (using solid or open icons as appropriate). For example, a task could flow to an event that throws a message across to another pool, where a subsequent event waits to catch the response before continuing. End event Represents the result of a process; indicated by a single thick or bold border, and can only Throw, so is shown with a solid icon. Activity An activity is represented with a rounded-corner rectangle and describes the kind of work which must be done. Task A task represents a single unit of work that is not or cannot be broken down to a further level of business process detail without diagramming the steps in a procedure (which is not the purpose of BPMN). Sub-process Used to hide or reveal additional levels of business process detail. When collapsed, a sub-process is indicated by a plus sign against the bottom line of the rectangle; when expanded, the rounded rectangle expands to show all flow objects, connecting objects, and artifacts. Has its own self-contained start and end events; sequence flows from the parent process must not cross the boundary. Transaction A form of sub-process in which all contained activities must be treated as a whole; i.e., they must all be completed to meet an objective, and if any one of them fails, they must all be compensated (undone). Transactions are differentiated from expanded sub-processes by being surrounded by a double border. Call Activity A point in the process where a global process or a global Task is reused. A call activity is differentiated from other activity types by a bolded border around the activity area. Gateway A gateway is represented with a diamond shape and determines forking and merging of paths, depending on the conditions expressed. Exclusive Used to create alternative flows in a process. Because only one of the paths can be taken, it is called exclusive. Event Based The condition determining the path of a process is based on an evaluated event. Parallel Used to create parallel paths without evaluating any conditions. Inclusive Used to create alternative flows where all paths are evaluated. Exclusive Event Based An event is being evaluated to determine which of mutually exclusive paths will be taken. Complex Used to model complex synchronization behavior. Parallel Event Based Two parallel processes are started based on an event, but there is no evaluation of the event. Connections Flow objects are connected to each other using Connecting objects, which are of three types: sequences, messages, and associations. Sequence Flow A Sequence Flow is represented with a solid line and arrowhead, and shows in which order the activities are performed. The sequence flow may also have a symbol at its start, a small diamond indicates one of a number of conditional flows from an activity, while a diagonal slash indicates the default flow from a decision or activity with conditional flows. Message Flow A Message Flow is represented with a dashed line, an open circle at the start, and an open arrowhead at the end. It tells us what messages flow across organizational boundaries (i.e., between pools). A message flow can never be used to connect activities or events within the same pool. Association An Association is represented with a dotted line. It is used to associate an Artifact or text to a Flow Object, and can indicate some directionality using an open arrowhead (toward the artifact to represent a result, from the artifact to represent an input, and both to indicate it is read and updated). No directionality is used when the Artifact or text is associated with a sequence or message flow (as that flow already shows the direction). Swim lanes are a visual mechanism of organising and categorising activities, based on cross functional flowcharting, and in BPMN consist of two types: Pool Represents major participants in a process, typically separating different organisations. A pool contains one or more lanes (like a real swimming pool). A pool can be open (i.e., showing internal detail) when it is depicted as a large rectangle showing one or more lanes, or collapsed (i.e., hiding internal detail) when it is depicted as an empty rectangle stretching the width or height of the diagram. Lane Used to organise and categorise activities within a pool according to function or role, and depicted as a rectangle stretching the width or height of the pool. A lane contains the flow objects, connecting objects and artifacts. Artifacts allow developers to bring some more information into the model/diagram. In this way the model/diagram becomes more readable. There are three pre-defined Artifacts and they are: Data objects: Data objects show the reader which data is required or produced in an activity. Group: A Group is represented with a rounded-corner rectangle and dashed lines. The group is used to group different activities but does not affect the flow in the diagram. Annotation: An annotation is used to give the reader of the model/diagram an understandable impression. The vision of BPMN 2.0 is to have one single specification for a new Business Process Model and Notation that defines the notation, metamodel and interchange format but with a modified name that still preserves the "BPMN" brand. The features include Aligning BPMN with the business process definition meta model BPDM to form a single consistent language. Enabling the exchange of business process models and their diagram layouts among process modeling tools to preserve semantic integrity. Expand BPMN to allow model orchestrations and choreographies as stand-alone or integrated models. Support the display and interchange of different perspectives on a model that allow a user to focus on specific concerns. Serialize BPMN and provide XML schemes for model transformation and to extend BPMN towards business modeling and executive decision support. The final version of the specification was released in January, 2011.[7] The scientific method is an ongoing process, which usually begins with observations about the natural world. Human beings are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear and often develop ideas (hypotheses) about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways, including making further observations about nature. In general, the strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled and replicated experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well the tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported a general theory may be developed.[1]The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigatingphenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.[2] To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.[3] The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses."[4] Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, identifiable features are frequently shared in common between them. The overall process of the scientific method involves making conjectures(hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions.[5][6] An hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question. The hypothesis might be very specific or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments. Under modern interpretations, a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested. The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.[7] Experiments can take place in a college lab, on a kitchen table, at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, at the bottom of an ocean, on Mars, and so on. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.[8] Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (or to the same degree), and are not always in the same order.[9]
