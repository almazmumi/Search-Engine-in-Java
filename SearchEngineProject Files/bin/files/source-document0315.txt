to the carpels. The fruit of the Hawthorn is a drupaceous pome, something between pome and drupe. 355. Of fruits which are externally fleshy and internally hard the leading kind is 356. =The Drupe=, or _Stone-fruit_; of which the cherry, plum, and peach (Fig. 375) are familiar examples. In this the outer part of the thickness of the pericarp becomes fleshy, or softens like a berry, while the inner hardens, like a nut. From the way in which the pistil is constructed, it is evident that the fleshy part here answers to the lower, and the stone to the upper face of the component leaf. The layers or concentric portions of a drupe, or of any pericarp which is thus separable, are named, when thus distinguishable into three portions,-- _Epicarp_, the external layer, often the mere skin of the fruit, _Mesocarp_, the middle layer, which is commonly the fleshy part, and _Endocarp_, the innermost layer, the stone. But more commonly only two portions of a drupe are distinguished, and are named, the outer one _Sarcocarp_ or _Exocarp_, for the flesh, the first name referring to the fleshy character, the second to its being an external layer; and _Putamen_ or _Endocarp_, the _Stone_, within. [Illustration: Fig. 375. Longitudinal section of a peach, showing flesh, stone, and seed.] 357. The typical or true drupe is of a single carpel. But, not to multiply technical names, this name is extended to all such fruits when fleshy without and stony within, although of compound pistil,--even to those having several or separable stones, such as the fruit of Holly. These stones in such drupes, or drupaceous fruits, are called _Pyrenæ_, or _Nucules_, or simply _Nutlets_ of the drupe. 358. Of Dry fruits, there is a greater diversity of kinds having distinct names. The indehiscent sorts are commonly one-seeded. [Illustration: Fig. 376. Akene of a Buttercup. 377. The same, divided lengthwise, to show the contained seed.] [Illustration: Fig. 378. Akene of Virgin's-bower, retaining the feathered style, which aids in dissemination.] 359. =The Akene or Achenium= is a small, dry and indehiscent one-seeded fruit, often so seed-like in appearance that it is popularly taken for a naked seed. The fruit of the Buttercup or Crowfoot is a good example, Fig. 376, 377. Its nature, as a ripened pistil (in this case a simple carpel), is apparent by its bearing the remains of a style or stigma, or a scar from which this has fallen. It may retain the style and use it in various ways for dissemination (Fig. 378). 360. The fruit of Compositæ (though not of a single carpel) is also an akene. In this case the pericarp is invested by an adherent calyx-tube; the limb of which, when it has any, is called the PAPPUS. This name was first given to the down like that of the Thistle, but is applied to all forms under which the limb of the calyx of the "compound flower" appears. In Lettuce, Dandelion (Fig. 384), and the like, the achenium as it matures tapers upwards into a slender beak, like a stalk to the pappus. [Illustration: Fig. 379. Akene of Mayweed (no pappus). 380. That of Succory (its pappus a shallow cup). 381. Of Sunflower (pappus of two deciduous scales). 382. Of Sneezeweed (Helenium), with its pappus of five scales. 383. Of Sow-Thistle, with its pappus of delicate downy hairs. 384. Of the Dandelion, its pappus raised on a long beak.] 361. =A Cremocarp= (Fig. 385), a name given to the fruit of Umbelliferæ, consists as it were of a pair of akenes united completely in the blossom, but splitting apart when ripe into the two closed carpels. Each of these is a _Mericarp_ or _Hemicarp_, names seldom used. 362. =A Utricle= is the same as an akene, but with a thin and bladdery loose pericarp; like that of the Goosefoot or Pigweed (Fig. 386). When ripe it may burst open irregularly to discharge the seed; or it may open by a circular line all round, the upper part falling off like a lid; as in the Amaranth (Fig. 387). [Illustration: Fig. 385. Fruit (cremocarp) of Osmorrhiza; the two akene-like ripe carpels separating at maturity from a slender axis or carpophore.] [Illustration: Fig. 386. Utricle of the common Pigweed (Chenopodium album).] [Illustration: Fig. 387. Utricle (pyxis) of Amaranth, opening all round (circumscissile).] 363. =A Caryopsis, or Grain=, is like an akene with the seed adhering to the thin pericarp throughout, so that fruit and seed are incorporated into one body; as in wheat, Indian corn, and other kinds of grain. 364. =A Nut= is a dry and indehiscent fruit, commonly one-celled and one-seeded, with a hard, crustaceous, or bony wall, such as the cocoa-nut, hazelnut, chestnut, and the acorn (Fig. 37, 388.) Here the involucre, in the form of a cup at the base, is called the CUPULE. In the Chestnut the cupule forms the bur; in the Hazel, a leafy husk. [Illustration: Fig. 388. Nut (acorn) of the Oak, with its cup or cupule.] 365. =A Samara, or Key-fruit=, is either a nut or an akene, or any other indehiscent fruit, furnished with a wing, like that of Ash (Fig. 389), and Elm (Fig. 390). The Maple-fruit is a pair of keys (Fig. 391). 366. Dehiscent Fruits, or Pods, are of two classes, viz., those of a simple pistil or carpel, and those of a compound pistil. Two common sorts of the first are named as follows:-- 367. =The Follicle= is a fruit of a simple carpel, which dehisces down one side only, i. e. by the inner or ventral suture. The fruits of Marsh Marigold (Fig. 392), Pæony, Larkspur, and Milkweed are of this kind. [Illustration: Fig. 389. Samara or key of the White Ash, winged at end. 390. Samara of the American Elm, winged all round.] [Illustration: Fig. 391. Pair of samaras of Sugar Maple.] [Illustration: Fig. 392. Follicle of Marsh Marigold (Caltha palustris).] [Illustration: Fig. 393. Legume of a Sweet Pea, opened.] [Illustration: Fig. 394. Loment or jointed legume of a Tick-Trefoil (Desmodium).] 368. =The Legume= or true Pod, such as the peapod (Fig. 393), and the fruit of the Leguminous or Pulse family generally, is one which opens along the dorsal as well as the ventral suture. The two pieces into which it splits are called VALVES. A LOMENT is a legume which is constricted between the seeds, and at length breaks up crosswise into distinct joints, as in Fig. 394. 369. The pods or dehiscent fruits belonging to a compound ovary have several technical names: but they all may be regarded as kinds of 370. =The Capsule=, the dry and dehiscent fruit of any compound pistil. The capsule may discharge its seeds through chinks or pores, as in the Poppy, or burst irregularly in some part, as in Lobelia and the Snapdragon; but commonly it splits open (or is _dehiscent_) lengthwise into regular pieces, called VALVES. [Illustration: Fig. 395. Capsule of Iris, with loculicidal dehiscence; below, cut across.] [Illustration: Fig. 396. Pod of a Marsh St. John's-wort, with septicidal dehiscence.] 371. Regular _Dehiscence_ in a capsule takes place in two ways, which are best illustrated in pods of two or three cells. It is either _Loculicidal_, or, splitting directly into the _loculi_ or cells, that is, down the back (or the dorsal suture) of each cell or carpel, as in Iris (Fig. 395); or _Septicidal_, that is, splitting through the partitions or _septa_, as in St. John's-wort (Fig. 396), Rhododendron, etc. This divides the capsule into its component carpels, which then open by their ventral suture. [Illustration: Fig. 397, 398. Diagrams of the two modes.] [Illustration: Fig. 399. Diagram of septifragal dehiscence of the loculicidal type. 400. Same of the septicidal or _marginicidal_ type.] 372. In loculicidal dehiscence the valves naturally bear the partitions on their middle; in the septicidal, half the thickness of a partition is borne on the margin of each valve. See the annexed diagrams. A variation of either mode occurs when the valves break away from the partitions, these remaining attached in the axis of the fruit. This is called _Septifragal_ dehiscence. One form is seen in the Morning-Glory (Fig. 400). 373. The capsules of Rue, Spurge, and some others, are both loculicidal and septicidal, and so split into half-carpellary valves or pieces. 374. =The Silique= (Fig. 401) is the technical name of the peculiar pod of the Mustard family; which is two-celled by a false partition stretched across between two parietal placentæ. It generally opens by two valves from below upward, and the placentæ with the partition are left behind when the valves fall off. 375. =A Silicle or Pouch= is only a short and broad silique, like that of the Shepherd's Purse, Fig. 402, 403. [Illustration: Fig. 401. Silique of a Cadamine or Spring Cress.] [Illustration: Fig. 402. Silicle of Shepherd's Purse.] [Illustration: Fig. 403. Same, with one valve removed.] [Illustration: Fig. 404. Pyxis of Purslane, the lid detaching.] 376. =The Pyxis= is a pod which opens by a circular horizontal line, the upper part forming a lid, as in Purslane (Fig. 404), the Plantain, Henbane,
