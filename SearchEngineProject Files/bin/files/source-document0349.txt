A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed, laying out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software. Software requirements specification establishes the basis for an agreement between customers and contractors or suppliers (in market-driven projects, these roles may be played by the marketing and development divisions) on what the software product is to do as well as what it is not expected to do. Software requirements specification permits a rigorous assessment of requirements before design can begin and reduces later redesign. It should also provide a realistic basis for estimating product costs, risks, and schedules.[1] The software requirements specification document enlists enough and necessary requirements that are required for the project development.[2] To derive the requirements we need to have clear and thorough understanding of the products to be developed or being developed. This is achieved and refined with detailed and continuous communications with the project team and customer till the completion of the software. The SRS may be one of a contract deliverable Data Item Descriptions[3] or have other forms of organizationally-mandated content. An example organization of an SRS is as follows:[4] Introduction Purpose Definitions System overview References Overall description Product perspective System Interfaces User Interfaces Hardware interfaces Software interfaces Communication Interfaces Memory Constraints Operations Site Adaptation Requirements Product functions User characteristics Constraints, assumptions and dependencies Specific requirements External interface requirements Functional requirements Performance requirements Design constraints Standards Compliance Logical database requirement Software System attributes Reliability Availability Security Maintainability Portability Other requirements One of the main values of writing specifications is to have them reviewed by stakeholders and to allow the stakeholders to provide feedback. Therefore, specifications should be written in such a way that they can easily be read and reviewed. Some of the questions to ask yourself about readability is: Does the specification contain a high-level description of the scope of the work? Does the formatting allow a reader to easily navigate the specification? Does the formatting allow a reader to easily understand the primary versus secondary cases? Does the specification contain links to related features? Does the specification call out questions which still need to be addressed? A concept of operations (abbreviated CONOPS, CONOPs,[1] or ConOps[2]) is a document describing the characteristics of a proposed system from the viewpoint of an individual who will use that system. It is used to communicate the quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to all stakeholders.[2] CONOPS are widely used in the military, governmental services and other fields. A CONOPS generally evolves from a concept and is a description of how a set of capabilities may be employed to achieve desired objectives or end state.[1] In the field of joint military operations, a CONOPS in DoD terminology is a verbal or graphic statement that clearly and concisely expresses what the joint force commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources.[3][4] CONOPS may also be used or summarized in system acquisition DODAF descriptions such as the OV-1 High Level Operational Concept Graphic. [5] Description[edit] Concept of Operations documents can be developed in many different ways, but usually share the same properties. In general, a CONOPS will include the following:[6] Statement of the goals and objectives of the system Strategies, tactics, policies, and constraints affecting the system Organizations, activities, and interactions among participants and stakeholders Clear statement of responsibilities and authorities delegated Specific operational processes for fielding the system Processes for initiating, developing, maintaining, and retiring the system A CONOPS should relate a narrative of the process to be followed in implementing a system. It should define the roles of the stakeholders involved throughout the process. Ideally it offers clear methodology to realize the goals and objectives for the system, while not intending to be an implementation or transition plan itself.[6] A CONOPS Standard is available to guide the development of a CONOPS document.[7] [8] The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard is structured around information systems, but the standard may be applied to other complex systems as well.
