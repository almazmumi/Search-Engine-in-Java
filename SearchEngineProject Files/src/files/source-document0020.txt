1977: Larry Ellison and friends founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL). 1978: Oracle Version 1, written in assembly language, runs on PDP-11 under RSX, in 128K of memory. Implementation separates Oracle code and user code. Oracle V1 is never officially released.[52] 1979: SDL changed its company-name to "Relational Software, Inc." (RSI) and introduced its product Oracle V2 as an early relational database system - often cited[53][54] as the first commercially sold RDBMS.[55] The version did not support transactions, but implemented the basic SQL functionality of queries and joins. (RSI never released a version 1 - instead calling the first version version 2 as a marketing gimmick.)[56] 1982: RSI in its turn changed its name, becoming known as "Oracle Corporation",[57] to align itself more closely with its flagship product. 1983: The company released Oracle version 3, which it had re-written using the C programming language, and which supported COMMIT and ROLLBACK functionality for transactions. Version 3 extended platform support from the existing Digital VAX/VMS systems to include Unix environments.[57] 1984: Oracle Corporation released Oracle version 4, which supported read-consistency.[58] In October it also released the first Oracle for the IBM PC.[59] 1985: Oracle Corporation released Oracle version 5, which supported the client–server model—a sign of networks becoming more widely available in the mid-1980s. 1986: Oracle version 5.1 started supporting distributed queries. 1988: Oracle RDBMS version 6 came out with support for PL/SQL embedded within Oracle Forms v3 (version 6 could not store PL/SQL in the database proper), row-level locking and hot backups.[60] 1989: Oracle Corporation entered the application-products market and developed its ERP product, (later to become part of the Oracle E-Business Suite), based on the Oracle relational database. 1990: the release of Oracle Applications release 8[57] 1992: Oracle version 7 appeared with support for referential integrity, stored procedures and triggers. 1997: Oracle Corporation released version 8, which supported object-oriented development and multimedia applications. 1999: The release of Oracle8i aimed to provide a database inter-operating better with the Internet (the i in the name stands for "Internet"). The Oracle8i database incorporated a native Java virtual machine (Oracle JVM, also known as "Aurora").[61] 2000: Oracle E-Business Suite 11i pioneers integrated enterprise application software[57] 2001: Oracle9i went into release with 400 new features, including the ability to read and write XML documents. 9i also provided an option for Oracle RAC, or "Real Application Clusters", a computer-cluster database, as a replacement for the Oracle Parallel Server (OPS) option. 2002: the release of Oracle 9i Database Release 2 (9.2.0)[62] 2003: Oracle Corporation released Oracle Database 10g, which supported regular expressions. (The g stands for "grid"; emphasizing a marketing thrust of presenting 10g as "grid computing ready".) 2005: Oracle Database 10.2.0.1—also known as Oracle Database 10g Release 2 (10gR2)—appeared. 2006: Oracle Corporation announces Unbreakable Linux[57] and acquires i-flex 2007: Oracle Database 10g release 2 sets a new world record TPC-H 3000 GB benchmark result[63] 2007: Oracle Corporation released Oracle Database 11g for Linux and for Microsoft Windows. 2008: Oracle Corporation acquires BEA Systems. 2010: Oracle Corporation acquires Sun Microsystems. 2011: Oracle Corporation acquires web content management system FatWire Software. 2011: On October 18, Oracle Corporation acquires Endeca Technologies Inc. faceted search engine software vendor. 2013: Oracle Corporation released Oracle Database 12c[64] for Linux, Solaris and Windows. (The c stands for "cloud".) Patch Updates and Security Alerts[edit] Oracle Corporation releases Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) or Security Patch Updates (SPUs)[65] and Security Alerts to close security holes that could be used for data theft. Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Security Alerts come out quarterly on the Tuesday closest to 17th day of the month. Customers may receive release notification by email. White Paper: Critical Patch Update Implementation Best Practices Version numbering[edit] Oracle products follow a custom release numbering and naming convention. With the Oracle RDBMS 10g release, Oracle Corporation began using the "10g" label in all versions of its major products, although some sources refer to Oracle Applications Release 11i as Oracle 11i.[clarification needed] The suffixes "i", "g" and "c" do not actually represent a low-order part of the version number, as letters typically represent in software industry version numbering; that is, there is no predecessor version of Oracle 10g called Oracle 10f. Instead, the letters stand for "internet", "grid" and "cloud", respectively.[66] Consequently many simply drop the "g" or "i" suffix when referring to specific versions of an Oracle product. Major database-related products and some of their versions include: Oracle Application Server 10g (also known as "Oracle AS 10g"): a middleware product; Oracle Applications Release 11i (aka Oracle e-Business Suite, Oracle Financials or Oracle 11i): a suite of business applications; Oracle Developer Suite 10g (9.0.4); Oracle JDeveloper 10g: a Java integrated development environment; Since version 2, Oracle's RDBMS release numbering has used the following codes: Oracle v2 : 2.3 Oracle v3 : 3.1.3 Oracle v4 : 4.1.4.0-4.1.4.4 Oracle v5 : 5.0.22, 5.1.17, 5.1.22 Oracle v6 : 6.0.17-6.0.36 (no OPS code), 6.0.37 (with OPS) Oracle7: 7.0.12–7.3.4 Oracle8 Database: 8.0.3–8.0.6 Oracle8i Database Release 1: 8.1.5.0–8.1.5.1 Oracle8i Database Release 2: 8.1.6.0–8.1.6.3 Oracle8i Database Release 3: 8.1.7.0–8.1.7.4 Oracle9i Database Release 1: 9.0.1.0–9.0.1.5 (Patchset as of December 2003) Oracle9i Database Release 2: 9.2.0.1–9.2.0.8 (Patchset as of April 2007) Oracle Database 10g Release 1: 10.1.0.2–10.1.0.5 (Patchset as of February 2006) Oracle Database 10g Release 2: 10.2.0.1–10.2.0.5 (Patchset as of April 2010) Oracle Database 11g Release 1: 11.1.0.6–11.1.0.7 (Patchset as of September 2008) Oracle Database 11g Release 2: 11.2.0.1–11.2.0.4 (Patchset as of August 2013) Oracle Database 12c Release 1: 12.1 (Patchset as of June 2013) Oracle Database 12c Release 1: 12.1.0.2 (Patchset as of July 2014) The version-numbering syntax within each release follows the pattern: major.maintenance.application-server.component-specific.platform-specific. For example, "10.2.0.1 for 64-bit Solaris" means: 10th major version of Oracle, maintenance level 2, Oracle Application Server (OracleAS) 0, level 1 for Solaris 64-bit.
