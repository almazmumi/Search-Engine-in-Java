lan of the flower, such as those of Fig. 225, 227, 241, 244, 275-277. For these, cross sections of the flower-bud or flower are to be made: and longitudinal sections, such as Fig. 270-274, are equally important. The dissection even of small seeds is not difficult after some practice. Commonly they need to be soaked or boiled. 575. The right appreciation of characters and terms used in description needs practice and calls for judgment. Plants do not grow exactly by rule and plummet, and measurements must be taken loosely. Difference of soil and situation are responded to by considerable variations, and other divergences occur which cannot be accounted for by the surroundings, nor be anticipated in general descriptions. Annuals may be very depauperate in dry soils or seasons, or very large when particularly well nourished. Warm and arid situations promote, and wet ones are apt to diminish pubescence. Salt water causes increased succulence. The color of flowers is apt to be lighter in shade, and brighter in open and elevated situations. A color or hue not normal to the species now and then occurs, which nothing in the conditions will account for. _A white-flowered variation of any other colored blossom may always be expected_; this, though it may be notable, no more indicates a distinct variety of the species than an albino would a variety of the human species. The numerical plan is subject to variation in some flowers; those on the plan of five may now and then vary to four or to six. Variations of the outline or lobing of leaves are so familiar that they do not much mislead. Only wider and longer observation suffices to prevent or correct mistakes in botanical study. But the weighing of evidence and the balancing of probabilities, no less than the use of the well-ordered and logical system of classification, give as excellent training to the judgment as the search for the facts themselves does to the observing powers. § 4. SIGNS AND ABBREVIATIONS. 576. For a full account of these, whether of former or actual use, see "Structural Botany" of the "Botanical Text Book," pp. 367, 392, as also for the principles which govern the accentuation of names. It is needful here to explain only those used in the Manuals and Floras of this country, for which the present volume is an introduction and companion. They are not numerous. 577. In arranging the species, at least those of a large genus, the divisions are denoted and graduated as follows: The sign § is prefixed to sections of the highest rank: these sections when they have names affixed to them (as Prunus § Cerasus) may be called subgenera. When the divisions of a genus are not of such importance, or when divisions are made under the subgenus itself, the most comprehensive ones are marked by asterisks, * for the first, * * for the second, and so on. Subdivisions are marked with a prefixed +; those under this head with ++; and those under this with =, if there be so many grades. A similar notation is followed in the synopsis of the genera of an order. 578. The interrogation point is used in botany to indicate doubt. Thus _Clematis crispa_, L.? expresses a doubt whether the plant in question is really the _Clematis crispa_ of Linnæus. _Clematis? polypetala_ expresses a doubt whether the plant so named is really a Clematis. On the other hand the exclamation point (!) is used to denote certainty whenever there is special need to affirm this. 579. For size or height, the common signs of degrees, minutes, and seconds, have been used, thus, 1°, 2', 3", stand respectively for a foot, two inches, and three lines or twelfths of an inch. A better way, when such brevity is needed, is to write 1^{ft}. 2^{in}. 3^{l}. 580. Signs for duration used by Linnæus were ☉ for an annual, ♂ for a biennial, ♃ for a perennial herb, [Symbol like numeral 5 without the top bar] for a shrub or tree. DeCandolle brought in ☉ for a plant that died after once flowering, ① if annual, ② if biennial. 581. To indicate sexes, ♂ means staminate or male plant or blossom; ♀, pistillate or female; [Symbol like ☿, but with two inverted breve accents over it], perfect or hermaphrodite. 582. To save room it is not uncommon to use ∞ in place of "many;" thus, "Stamens ∞," for stamens indefinitely numerous: "∞ flora" for pluriflora or many-flowered. Still more common is the form "Stamens 5-20," or "Calyx 4-5-parted," for stamens from five to twenty, calyx four-parted or five-parted, and the like. Such abbreviations hardly need explanation. 583. The same may be said of such abbreviations as _Cal._ for calyx, _Cor._ for corolla, _Pet._ for petals, _St._ for stamens, _Pist._ for pistil, _Hab._ for habitat, meaning place of growth, _Herb._ for herbarium, _Hort._ for garden. Also _l. c._, loco citato, which avoids repetition of volume and page. 584. "Structural Botany" has six pages of abbreviations of the names of botanists, mostly of botanical authors. As they are not of much consequence to the beginner, while the more advanced botanist will know the names in full, or know where to find them, only a selection is here appended.
