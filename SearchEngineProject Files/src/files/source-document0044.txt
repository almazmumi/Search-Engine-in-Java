 An enterprise information system (EIS) is any kind of information system which improves the functions of an enterprise business processes by integration. This means typically offering high quality of service, dealing with large volumes of data and capable of supporting some large and possibly complex organization or enterprise. An EIS must be able to be used by all parts and all levels of an enterprise.[1] The word enterprise can have various connotations. Frequently the term is used only to refer to very large organizations such as multi-national companies or public sector organizations. However, the term may be used to mean virtually anything, by virtue of it having become the latest corporate-speak buzzword. Enterprise information systems provide a technology platform that enables organizations to integrate and coordinate their business processes on a robust foundation. An EIS is currently used in conjunction with customer relationship management and supply chain management to automate business processes.[1] An enterprise information system provides a single system that is central to the organization and that ensures information can be shared across all functional levels and management hierarchies. An EIS can be used to increase business productivity and reduce sThe Internet protocol suite is the computer networking model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks.

Other outcomes include higher operational efficiency and cost savings.[1] Financial value is not usually a direct outcome from the implementation of an enterprise information system.[2] Information systems[edit] Main article: Information systems Enterprise systems create a standard data structure and are invaluable in eliminating the problem of information fragmentation caused by multiple information systems within an organization. An EIS differentiates itself from legacy systems in that it self-transactional, self-helping and adaptable to general and specialist conditions.[1] Unlike an enterprise information system, legacy systems are limited to department wide communications.[2] A typical enterprise information system would be housed in one or more data centers, would run enterprise software, and could include applications that typically cross organizational borders such as content management systems. Decision engineering (more recently called Decision Intelligence by The Decision Intelligence Institute International[1] and companies like Quantellia[2]) is a framework that unifies a number of best practices for organizational decision making. It is based on the recognition that, in many organizations, decision making could be improved if a more structured approach were used. Decision engineering seeks to overcome a decision making "complexity ceiling", which is characterized by a mismatch between the sophistication of organizational decision making practices and the complexity of situations in which those decisions must be made. As such, it seeks to solve some of the issues identified around complexity theory and organizations. In this sense, decision engineering represents a practical application of the field of complex systems, which helps organizations to navigate the complex systems in which they find themselves. Decision engineering can also be thought of as a framework that brings advanced analytics techniques to the desktop of the non-expert decision maker, as well as incorporating, and then extending, inductive reasoning and machine learning techniques to overcome the problems articulated in Black swan theory.[citation needed] Decision engineering proponents[3] believe that many organizations continue to make poor decisions.[4][5] In response, decision engineering seeks to unify a number of decision making best practices, described in more detail below. Decision engineering builds on the insight that it is possible to design the decision itself, using principles previously used for designing more tangible objects like bridges and buildings.[6] The use of a visual design language representing decisions is an important element of decision engineering, since it provides an intuitive common language readily understood by all decision participants. A visual metaphor[7] improves the ability to reason about complex systems[8] as well as to enhance collaboration. In addition to visual decision design, there are other two aspects of engineering disciplines that aid mass adoption. These are: 1) the creation of a shared language of design elements and 2) the use of a common methodology or process, as illustrated in the diagram above. The need for a unified methodology of decision making is driven by a number of factors that organizations face as they make difficult decisions in a complex internal and external environment. Recognition of the broad-based inability of current methods to solve decision making issues in practice comes from several sources, including government sources and industries such as telecommunications, media, the automotive industry, and pharmaceuticals. Examples: The outcomes of decisions are becoming more complex, going well beyond next quarter's revenues or other tangible outcomes to multiple goals that must be satisfied together, some of which are often intangible: The car is becoming an expression of identity, values, and personal control in ways that move far beyond traditional segmentation and branding. For example, fuel efficiency will be only one consideration for a socially responsible vehicle (SRV). What percent of the parts are recyclable? What is the vehicle's total carbon footprint? Are there child labor inputs? Toxic paints, glues, or plastics? How transparent is the supply chain? Is the seller accountable for recycling? What methods are used? Are fair labor practices employed?

Business Week, November 18, 2008 Global increase in complexity: We live in a dynamic world in which the pace, scope, and complexity of change are increasing. The continued march of globalization, the growing number of independent actors, and advancing technology have increased global connectivity, interdependence and complexity, creating greater uncertainties, systemic risk and a less predictable future. These changes have led to reduced warning times and compressed decision cycles.
