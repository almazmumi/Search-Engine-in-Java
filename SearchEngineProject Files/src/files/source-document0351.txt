. Mitella and Dionæa help out this conception. [Illustration: Fig. 333. Plan of a one-celled ovary of three carpel-leaves, with parietal placentæ, cut across below, where it is complete; the upper part showing the top of the three leaves it is composed of, approaching, but not united.] [Illustration: Fig. 334. Cross section of the ovary of Frost weed (Helianthemum), with three parietal placentæ, bearing ovules.] [Illustration: Fig. 335. Cross section of an ovary of Hypericum graveolens, the three large placentæ meeting in the centre, so as to form a three-celled ovary. 336. Same in fruit, the placentæ now separate and rounded.] 312. =One-celled, with Parietal Placentæ.= In this not uncommon case it is conceived that the two or three or more carpel-leaves of such a compound pistil coalesce by their adjacent edges, just as sepal-leaves do to form a gamosepalous calyx, or petals to form a gamopetalous corolla, and as is shown in the diagram, Fig. 333, and in an actual cross-section, Fig. 334. Here each carpel is an open leaf, or with some introflexion, bearing ovules along its margins; and each placenta consists of the contiguous margins of two pistil-leaves grown together. There is every gradation beIn psychology, social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, scientific refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being.tween this and the three-celled ovary with the placentæ in the axis, even in the same genus, sometimes even in different stages in the same pistil (Fig. 335, 336). § 2. GYMNOSPERMOUS GYNŒCIUM. 313. The ordinary pistil has a closed ovary, and accordingly the pollen can act upon the contained ovules only indirectly, through the stigma. This is expressed in a term of Greek derivation, viz.:-- _Angiospermous_, meaning that the seeds are borne in a sac or closed vessel. The counterpart term is _Gymnospermous_, meaning naked-seeded. This kind of pistil, or gynœcium, the simplest of all, yet the most peculiar, characterizes the Pine family and its relatives. [Illustration: Fig. 337. A pistil, that is, a scale of the cone, of a Larch, at the time of flowering; inside view, showing its pair of naked ovules.] [Illustration: Fig. 338. Branchlet of the American Arbor-Vitæ, considerably larger than in nature, terminated by its pistillate flowers, each consisting of a single scale (an open pistil), together forming a small cone.] [Illustration: Fig. 339. One of the scales or carpels of the last, removed and more enlarged, the inside exposed to view, showing a pair of ovules on its base.] 314. While the ordinary simple pistil is conceived by the botanist to be a leaf rolled together into a closed pod (306), those of the Pine, Larch (Fig. 337), Cedar, and Arbor-Vitæ (Fig. 338, 339) are open leaves, in the form of scales, each bearing two or more ovules on the inner face, next the base. At the time of blossoming, these pistil-leaves of the young cone diverge, and the pollen, so abundantly shed from the staminate blossoms, falls directly upon the exposed ovules. Afterward the scales close over each other until the seeds are ripe. Then they separate that the seeds may be shed. As the pollen acts directly on the ovules, such pistil (or organ acting as pistil) has no stigma. 315. In the Yew, and in Torreya and Gingko, the gynœcium is reduced to extremest simplicity, that is, to a naked ovule, without any visible carpel. 316. In Cycas the large naked ovules are borne on the margins or lobes of an obvious open leaf. All GYMNOSPERMOUS plants have other peculiarities, also distinguishing them, as a class, from ANGIOSPERMOUS plants. Section XI. OVULES. 317. =Ovule= (from the Latin, meaning a little egg) is the technical name of that which in the flower answers to and becomes the seed. [Illustration: Fig. 340. A cluster of ovules, pendulous on their funicles.] 318. Ovules are _naked_ in gymnospermous plants (as just described), in all others they are enclosed in the ovary. They may be produced along the whole length of the cell or cells of the ovary, and then they are apt to be numerous, or only from some part of it, generally the top or the bottom. In this case they are usually few or single (_solitary_, as in Fig. 341-343). They may be _sessile_, i. e. without stalk, or they may be attached by a distinct stalk, the FUNICLE or FUNICULUS (Fig. 340). [Illustration: Fig. 341. Section of the ovary of a Buttercup, lengthwise, showing its ascending ovule.] [Illustration: Fig. 342. Section of the ovary of Buckwheat, showing the erect ovule.] [Illustration: Fig. 343. Section of the ovary of Anemone, showing its suspended ovule.] 319. Considered as to then position and direction in the ovary, they are _Horizontal_, when they are neither turned upward nor downward, as in Podophyllum (Fig. 326), _Ascending_, when rising obliquely upwards, usually from the side of the cell, not from its very base, as in the Buttercup (Fig. 341), and the Purslane (Fig. 272), _Erect_, when rising upright from the very base of the cell, as in the Buckwheat (Fig. 342), _Pendulous_, when hanging from the side or from near the top, as in the Flax (Fig. 270), and _Suspended_, when hanging perpendicularly from the very summit of the cell, as in the Anemone (Fig. 343). All these terms equally apply to seeds. 320. In structure an ovule is a pulpy mass of tissue, usually with one or two coats or coverings. The following parts are to be noted, viz.-- KERNEL or NUCLEUS, the body of the ovule. In the Mistletoe and some related plants, there is only this nucleus, the coats being wanting. TEGUMENTS, or coats, sometimes only one, more commonly two. When two, one has been called PRIMINE, the other SECUNDINE. It will serve all purposes to call them simply outer and inner ovule coats. ORIFICE, or FORAMEN, an opening through the coats at the organic apex of the ovule. In the seed it is _Micropyle_. CHALAZA, the place where the coats and the kernel of the ovule blend. HILUM, the place of junction of the funiculus with the body of the ovule. [Illustration: Fig. 344. Orthotropous ovule of Buckwheat: _c_, hilum and chalaza; _f_, orifice.] [Illustration: Fig. 345. Campylotropous ovule of a Chickweed: _c_, hilum and chalaza; _f_, orifice.] [Illustration: Fig. 346. Amphitropous ovule of Mallow: _f_, orifice; _h_, hilum; _r_, rhaphe; _c_, chalaza.] [Illustration: Fig. 347. Anatropous ovule of a Violet, the parts lettered as in the last.] 321. =The Kinds of Ovules.= The ovules in their growth develop in three or four different ways and thereby are distinguished into _Orthotropous_ or _Straight_, those which develop without curving or turning, as in Fig. 344. The chalaza is at the insertion or base, the foramen or orifice is at the apex. This is the simplest, but the least common kind of ovule. _Campylotropous_ or _Incurved_, in which, by the greater growth of one side, the ovule curves into a kidney-shaped outline, so bringing the orifice down close to the base or chalaza; as in Fig. 345. _Amphitropous_ or _Half Inverted_, Fig. 346. Here the forming ovule, instead of curving perceptibly, keeps its axis nearly straight, and, as it grows, turns round upon its base so far as to become transverse to its funiculus, and adnate to its upper part for some distance. Therefore in this case the attachment of the funiculus or stalk is about the middle, the chalaza is at one end, the orifice at the other. [Illustration: Fig. 348-350. Three early stages in the growth of ovule of a Magnolia, showing the forming outer and inner coats which even in the later figure have not yet completely enclosed the nucleus; 351, further advanced, and 352, completely anatropous ovule.] [Illustration: Fig. 353. Longitudinal section, and 354, transverse section of 352.] [Illustration: Fig. 355. Same as 353, enlarged showing the parts in section: _a_, outer coat; _b_, inner coat; _c_, nucleus; _d_, rhaphe.] _Anatropous_ or _Inverted_, as in Fig. 347, the commonest kind, so called because in its growth it has as it were turned over upon its stalk, to which it has continued adnate. The organic base, or chalaza, thus becomes the apparent summit, and the orifice is at the base, by the side of the hilum or place of attachment. The adnate portion of the funiculus, which appears as a ridge or cord extending from the hilum to the chalaza, and which distinguishes this kind of ovule, is called the RHAPHE. The amphitropous ovule (Fig. 346) has a short or incomplete rhaphe. 322. Fig. 348-352 show the stages through which an ovule becomes anatropous in the course of its growth. The annexed two figures are sections of such an ovule at maturity; and Fig. 355 is Fig. 353 enlarged, with the parts lettered. Section XII. MODIFICATIONS OF THE RECEPTACLE. [Illustration: Fig. 356.
