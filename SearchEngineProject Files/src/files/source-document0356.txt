sected_ (Fig. 155), etc., according to the number of the divisions. [Illustration: Fig. 148, pinnately lobed; 149, pinnately cleft; 150, pinnately parted; 151, pinnately divided, leaves.] [Illustration: Fig. 152, palmately three-lobed; 153, palmately three-cleft; 154, palmately three-parted; 155, palmately three-divided or trisected, leaves.] 141. =The Mode of Lobing or Division= corresponds to that of the veining, whether _pinnately veined_ or _palmately veined_. In the former the notches or incisions, or _sinuses_, coming between the principal veins or ribs are directed toward the midrib: in the latter they are directed toward the apex of the petiole; as the figures show. 142. So degree and mode of division may be tersely expressed in brief phrases. Thus, in the four upper figures of pinnately veined leaves, the first is said to be _pinnately lobed_ (in the special sense), the second _pinnately cleThey defined quality of working life as satisfaction of these key needs through resources, activities, and outcomes stemming from participation in the workplace. Needs as defined by the psychologist, Abraham Maslow, were seen as relevant in underpinning this model, covering health & safety, economic and family, social, esteem, actualisation, knowledge and aestheticsft_ (or _pinnatifid_ in Latin form), the third _pinnately parted_, the fourth _pinnately divided_, or _pinnatisected_. 143. Correspondingly in the lower row, of palmately veined leaves, the first is _palmately lobed_, the second _palmately cleft_, the third _palmately parted_, the fourth _palmately divided_. Or, in other language of the same meaning (but now less commonly employed), they are said to be _digitately lobed_, _cleft_, _parted_, or _divided_. 144. The number of the divisions or lobes may come into the phrase. Thus in the four last named figures the leaves are respectively _palmately three-lobed_, _three-cleft_ (or _trifid_), _three-parted_, _three-divided_, or better (in Latin form), _trisected_. And so for higher numbers, as _five-lobed_, _five-cleft_, etc., up to _many-lobed_, _many-cleft_ or _multifid_, etc. The same mode of expression may be used for pinnately lobed leaves, as _pinnately 7-lobed_, _-cleft_, _-parted_, etc. 145. The divisions, lobes, etc., may themselves be _entire_ (without teeth or notches), or _serrate_, or otherwise toothed or incised; or lobed, cleft, parted, etc.: in the latter cases making _twice pinnatifid_, _twice palmately_ or _pinnately lobed_, _parted_, or _divided_ leaves, etc. From these illustrations one will perceive how the botanist, in two or three words, may describe any one of the almost endlessly diversified shapes of leaves, so as to give a clear and definite idea of it. 146. =Compound Leaves.= A compound leaf is one which has its blade in entirely separate parts, each usually with a stalklet of its own; and the stalklet is often _jointed_ (or _articulated_) with the main leaf-stalk, just as this is jointed with the stem. When this is the case, there is no doubt that the leaf is compound. But when the pieces have no stalklets, and are not jointed with the main leaf-stalk, it may be considered either as a divided simple leaf, or a compound leaf, according to the circumstances. This is a matter of names where all intermediate forms may be expected. 147. While the pieces or projecting parts of a simple leaf-blade are called _Lobes_, or in deeply cut leaves, etc., _Segments_, or _Divisions_, the separate pieces or blades of a compound leaf are called LEAFLETS. 148. Compound leaves are of two principal kinds, namely, the _Pinnate_ and the _Palmate_; answering to the two modes of veining in reticulated leaves, and to the two sorts of lobed or divided leaves (141). [Illustration: Fig. 156-158. Pinnate leaves, the first with an odd leaflet (_odd-pinnate_); the second with a tendril in place of uppermost leaflets; the third _abruptly pinnate_, or of even pairs.] 149. _Pinnate_ leaves are those in which the leaflets are arranged on the sides of a main leaf-stalk; as in Fig. 156-158. They answer to the _feather-veined_ (i. e. _pinnately-veined_) simple leaf; as will be seen at once on comparing the forms. The _leaflets_ of the former answer to the _lobes_ or _divisions_ of the latter; and the continuation of the petiole, along which the leaflets are arranged, answers to the midrib of the simple leaf. 150. Three sorts of pinnate leaves are here given. Fig. 156 is _pinnate with an odd_ or _end leaflet_, as in the Common Locust and the Ash. Fig. 157 is _pinnate with a tendril at the end_, in place of the odd leaflet, as in the Vetches and the Pea. Fig. 158 is evenly or _abruptly pinnate_, as in the Honey-Locust. [Illustration: Fig. 159. Palmate (or digitate) leaf of five leaflets, of the Sweet Buckeye.] 151. _Palmate_ (also named _Digitate_) leaves are those in which the leaflets are all borne on the tip of the leaf-stalk, as in the Lupine, the Common Clover, the Virginia Creeper (Fig. 93), and the Horse-chestnut and Buckeye (Fig. 159). They evidently answer to the _radiate-veined_ or _palmately-veined_ simple leaf. That is, the Clover-leaf of three leaflets is the same as a palmately three-ribbed leaf cut into three separate leaflets. And such a simple five-lobed leaf as that of the Sugar Maple, if more cut, so as to separate the parts, would produce a palmate leaf of five leaflets, like that of the Horse-chestnut or Buckeye. 152. Either sort of compound leaf may have any number of leaflets; yet palmate leaves cannot well have a great many, since they are all crowded together on the end of the main leaf-stalk. Some Lupines have nine or eleven; the Horse-chestnut has seven, the Sweet Buckeye more commonly five, the Clover three. A pinnate leaf often has only seven or five leaflets, or only three, as in Beans of the genus Phaseolus, etc.; in some rarer cases only two; in the Orange and Lemon and also in the common Barberry there is only one! The joint at the place where the leaflet is united with the petiole distinguishes this last case from a simple leaf. In other species of these genera the lateral leaflets also are present. 153. The leaflets of a compound leaf may be either _entire_ (as in Fig. 126-128), or _serrate_, or lobed, cleft, parted, etc.; in fact, may present all the variations of simple leaves, and the same terms equally apply to them. 154. When the division is carried so far as to separate what would be one leaflet into two, three, or several, the leaf becomes _doubly_ or _twice compound_, either _pinnately_ or _palmately_, as the case may be. For example, while the clustered leaves of the Honey-Locust are _simply pinnate_, that is, _once pinnate_, those on new shoots are _bipinnate_, or _twice pinnate_, as in Fig. 160. When these leaflets are again divided in the same way, the leaf becomes _thrice pinnate_, or _tripinnate_, as in many Acacias. The first divisions are called _Pinn√¶_; the others, _Pinnules_; and the last, or little blades themselves, _Leaflets_. [Illustration: Fig. 160. A twice-pinnate (abruptly) leaf of the Honey-Locust.] 155. So the palmate leaf, if again compounded in the same way, becomes _twice palmate_, or, as we say when the divisions are in threes, _twice ternate_ (in Latin form _biternate_); if a third time compounded, _thrice ternate_ or _triternate_. But if the division goes still further, or if the degree is variable, we simply say that the leaf is _decompound_; either palmately or pinnately decompound, as the case may be. Thus, Fig. 161 represents a four times ternately compound (in other words a _ternately decompound_) leaf of a common Meadow Rue. [Illustration: Fig. 161. Ternately decompound leaf of Meadow Rue.] 156. When the botanist, in describing leaves, wishes to express the number of the leaflets, he may use terms like these:-- _Unifoliolate_, for a compound leaf of a single leaflet; from the Latin _unum_, one, and _foliolum_, leaflet. _Bifoliolate_, of two leaflets, from the Latin _bis_, twice, and _foliolum_, leaflet. _Trifoliolate_ (or _ternate_), of three leaflets, as the Clover; and so on. _Palmately bifoliolate_, _trifoliolate_, _quadrifoliolate_, _plurifoliolate_ (of several leaflets), etc.: or else _Pinnately bi-_, _tri-_, _quadri-_, or _plurifoliolate_ (that is, of two, three, four, five, or several leaflets), as the case may be: these are terse ways of denoting in single phrases both the number of leaflets and the kind of compounding. 157. Of foliage-leaves having certain peculiarities in structure, the following may be noted:-- 158. =Perfoliate Leaves.= In these the stem that bears them seems to run through the blade of the leaf, more or less above its base. A common Bellwort (Uvularia perfoliata, Fig. 162) is a familiar illustration. The lower and earlier leaves show it distinctly. Later, the plant is apt to produce some leaves merely clasping the stem by the sessile and heart-shaped base, and the latest may be merely sessile. So the series explains the peculiarity: in the formation of the leaf the bases, meeting around the stem, grow together there. [Illustration: Fig. 162. A summer branch of Uvularia perfoliata; lower leaves perfoliate, upper cordate-clasping, uppermost simply sessile.] [Illustration: Fig. 163. Branch of a Honeysuckle, with connate-perfoliate leaves.] 159. =Connate-perfoliate.= Such are the upper leaves of true Honeysuc
