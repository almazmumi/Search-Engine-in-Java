In other words, in the nineteenth century the candle-hours obtainable for $20.00 per year increased about fifty times. Stated in another manner, the cost of light at the end of the century was about one fiftieth that of candle light at the beginning of the century. One authority in computing the expense of lighting to the householder in a large city of this country has stated that coincident with an increase of 1700 per cent. in the amount of night lighting of an American family, in average circumstances, using gas for light, there has come a reduction in the cost of the year's lighting of 34 per cent. or approximately $7.50 per year; and that the cost of lighting per unit of light--the candle-hour--is now but 2.8 per cent. of what it was in the first half of the nineteenth century. No other necessity of household use has been so cheapened and improved during the last century. In general, the light-user has taken advantage of the decrease by increasing the amount of light used and the period during which it is used. In this manner the greatly diminished cost of light has been a marked sociological and economic influence. After Murdock made his first installation of gas-lighting in an industrial plant early in the nineteenth century, he published a comparison of the expense of operation with that of candle-lighting. He arrived at the costs of light equivalent to 1000 candle-hours as follows: 1000 candle-hours Gas-lighting at a rate of two hours per day $1.95 " " " " " three " " " 1.40 Candle-lighting 6.50 It is seen that the longer hours of burning reduce the cost of gas-lighting by reducing the percentage of overhead charges. There are no such factors in lighting by candles because the whole "installation" is consumed. This is an early example of which an authentic record is available. At the present time a certain amount of light obtained for $1.00 with efficient tungsten filament lamps, costs $2.00 if obtained from kerosene flames and about $50.00 if obtained by burning candles. In order to obtain the cost of an equivalent amount of light throughout the past century a great many factors must be considered. Obviously, the results obtained by various persons will differ owing to the unavoidable factor of judgment; however, the following list of approximate values will at least indicate the trend of the price of light throughout the century or more of rapid developments in light-production. A fair average of the retail values of fuels and of electrical energy and an average luminous efficiency of the light-sources involved have been used in making the computations. The figures apply particularly to this country.

In the following table the price of food and of electric lighting are compared for twenty years preceding the recent war. The great disturbance due to the war is thereby eliminated from consideration, but it should be noted that since 1914 the price of food has greatly increased but that of electric lighting has not changed materially. The cost of each commodity is taken as one hundred units for the year 1894 but, of course, the actual cost of living for the householder is perhaps a hundred times greater than the cost of electric lighting.
