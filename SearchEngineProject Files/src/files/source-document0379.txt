iscrimination or injustice when the householder, for example, must pay more for his lighting than a factory pays. The rates are not only affected by "demand" but by the period in which the demand comes. Residence lighting is chiefly confined to certain hours from 5 to 9 P. M. and there is a great "peak" of demand at this time. The central-stations must have equipment available for this short-time demand and much of the capacity of the equipment is unused during the remainder of the day. The factory which uses electricity throughout the day or night or both is helping to keep the central-station operating efficiently. The equipment necessary to supply electricity to the factory is operating long hours. Not only is this overhead charge much less for factories and many other consumers than for the householder, but the expense of accounting, of reading meters, etc., is about the same for all classes of consumers. Therefore, this is an appreciable item on the bill of the small consumer. Doubtless, the public does not realize that the enormous decrease in the cost of lighting during the past century is due largely to the fact that the lighting industry has grown large. Increased production is responsible for some of this decrease and science for much of it. The latter, having been called to the aid of the manufacturers, who are better able by virtue of their magnitude to spend time and resources upon scientific developments, has responded with many improvements which have increased the efficiency of light-production. Some figures of the Census Bureau may be of interest. These are given for 1914 in order that the abnormal conditions due to the recent war may be avoided. The figures pertaining to the manufacture of gas for sale which do not include private plants are as follows for the year 1914 for this country: Number of establishments 1,284 Capital $1,252,421,584 Value of products (gas, coke, tar, etc.) $220,237,790 Cost of materials $76,779,288 Value added by manufacture $143,458,502 Value of gas $175,065,920 Coal used (tons) 6,116,672 Coke used (tons) 964,851 Oil used (gallons) 715,418,623 Length of gas mains (miles) 58,727 Manufactured products sold Total gas (cubic feet) 203,639,260,000 Straight coal gas (cubic feet) 10,509,946,000 Carbureted water gas (cubic feet) 90,017,725,000 Mixed coal- and water-gas (cubic feet) 86,281,339,000 Oil gas (cubic feet) 16,512,274,000 Acetylene (cubic feet) 136,564,000 Other gas, chiefly gasolene (cubic feet) 181,412,000 Coke (bushels) 114,091,753 Tar (gallons) 125,938,607 Ammonia liquors (gallons) 50,737,762 Ammonia, sulphate (pounds) 6,216,618 Of course, only a small fraction of the total gas manufactured is used for lighting. According to the U. S. Geological Survey, the quantities of gas sold in this country in the year 1917 were as follows: Coal-gas 42,927,728,000 cubic feet Water-gas 153,457,318,000 " " Oil-gas 14,739,508,000 " " Byproduct gas 131,026,575,000 " " Natural gas 795,110,376,000 " " In 1914 there were 38,705,496 barrels (each fifty gallons) of illuminating oils refined in this country and the value was $96,806,452. About half of this quantity was exported. In 1914 the value of all candles manufactured in this country was about $2,000,000, which was about half that of the candles manufactured in 1909 and in 1904. In 1914 the value of the matches manufactured in this country was $12,556,000. This has increased steadily from $429,000 in 1849. In 1914 the glass industries in this country made 7,000,000 lamps, 70,000,000 chimneys, 16,300,000 lantern globes, 24,000,000 shades, globes, and other gas goods. Many millions of other lighting accessories were made, but unfortunately they are not classified. Some figures pertaining to public electric light and power stations of the United States for the years 1907 and 1917 are as follows: 1917 1907 Number of establishments 6,541 4,714 Commercial 4,224 3,462 Municipal 2,317 1,562 Income $526,886,408 $175,642,338 Total horse-power of plants 12,857,998 4,098,188 Steam engines 8,389,389 2,693,273 Internal combustion engines 217,186 55,828 Water-wheels 4,251,423 1,349,087 Kilowatt capacity of generators 9,001,872 2,709,225 Output in millions of kilowatt-hours 25,438 5,863 Motors served (horse-power) 9,216,323 1,649,026 Electric-arc street-lamps served 256,838 .... Electric-filament street-lamps served 1,389,382 .... In general, there is a large increase in the various items during the decade represented. The output of the central stations doubled in the five years from 1907 to 1912, and doubled again in the next five years from 1912 to 1917. Street lamps were not reported in 1907, but in 1912 there were 348,643 arc-lamps served by the public companies. The number of arc-lamps decreased to 256,838 in 1917. On the other hand, there were 681,957 electric filament street lamps served in 1912, which doubled in number to 1,389,382 in 1917. The cost of construction and eq
